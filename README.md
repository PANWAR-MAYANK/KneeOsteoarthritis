# ü¶µ Knee Osteoarthritis Severity Classification with Deep Learning üß†

> **An AI-powered solution to automate knee osteoarthritis grading using X-ray images. Final ensemble model achieves 99.03% test accuracy.**

## üìå Overview

Knee Osteoarthritis (KOA) is a progressive joint disease affecting millions globally. Manual radiographic grading is time-consuming and subjective. This project uses deep learning to automate the classification of KOA severity from X-ray images into five distinct grades:

- **Healthy**
- **Doubtful**
- **Minimal**
- **Moderate**
- **Severe**

We fine-tuned **four CNN models** and built an **ensemble architecture** to boost performance and reliability. This can act as a clinical decision support tool, especially in radiology-heavy environments.
